Project opening part is okay

Spring Web
Spring Mongo
Lombok

Model/Entity Classes -> for the objects that will be created

Controller Classes -> Recieve rest requests

Service Classes -> Get the data or put the data -> Uses repository and places the data in the mongo data base

Repository ->


Product has private id, name, price attributes
Use lombok annotations for constructor, getter, setter

To insert a product to mongodb
    1. Rest controller kullanarak post/put method olan bi function yazıyoruz. Bu functionlar called api endpoints.
       public boolean createProduct() -> @PutMapping("/product")
       public boolean updateProduct -> PostMapping("/product/{id}")
       ...
    2. Product Repository açıyoruz, interface extending MongoRepository<Product,String> --> Dont have to write anything in this class
    3. Product Service logical işleri yapıyor.  We use @Servive annotation first. then have private ProductRepository ProductRepository as an attribute in service and IN THE CONTROLLER and write @Autowired before that
    4. Then write public void addProduct(Product p) -> productRepository.save(p)
    5. In controller we dont have to first create an object just call addProduct method
    6. Add product object in controller in addProduct method and use service classes method
    7. Start mongo from docker and add the gerekli şeyler to the application.properties -> spring mongo host= localhost and the port=27027 thing and database name = 310 or smth(yml file can be used -> in the class video)
    8. Create database in the mongo compass, try adding manually to check if it works
    9. You will have different URL identifier with name id e mail etc. in the controller mappings. Look from the video for the syntax -> @RequestBody
    10. Google only show get requests but you can use testfully to test others

    Get lists of products
    1. use productRepository.findAll() in the service and getAllPrduct in controller
